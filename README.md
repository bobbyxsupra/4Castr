An inventory replenishment calculator for Square. 
....
Make sure you have a .env file with the appropriate credentials before running.
....
The .env file should follow a simple key-value format where each line contains a key and its corresponding value separated by an equal sign (=). Here is an example of how your .env file might look:


SQUARE_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_square_access_token_here
LOCATION_ID=your_location_id_here


Replace your_square_access_token_here and your_location_id_here with your actual Square API access token and location ID values.

Example:
SQUARE_ACCESS_TOKEN=EAAAEHHla93cddklj2389adkfjhEWA9jda
LOCATION_ID=location_id_12345

Make sure there are no spaces around the equal sign, and avoid using quotes around the values. Save this file in the root directory with the .py file.
